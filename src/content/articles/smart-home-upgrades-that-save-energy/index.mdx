<h3>Daylight and Time-Based Controls</h3>
<p>Smart lighting systems can adjust based on the time of day or available natural light. Lights may dim when sunlight is strong and brighten as it gets darker. This balance reduces electricity use while keeping rooms well lit.</p>

<h2>Smart Plugs and Power Management</h2>
<p>Many electronics continue to use power even when turned off. This is known as standby power or phantom load. Smart plugs help manage this hidden energy use by controlling when devices receive power.</p>

<h3>Cutting Standby Power</h3>
<p>By plugging devices into smart outlets, users can schedule power to shut off completely when devices are not needed. Televisions, gaming systems, and office equipment often draw power all day unless disconnected. Smart plugs solve this problem automatically.</p>

<h3>Usage Monitoring</h3>
<p>Some smart plugs track how much energy each device uses. This information helps identify which electronics consume the most power. Once users see the data, they can decide whether to adjust usage, upgrade devices, or unplug items that are rarely used.</p>

<h3>Automation and Group Control</h3>
<p>Smart plugs can be grouped together and controlled at once. For example, all entertainment devices can turn off at bedtime with a single command or schedule. This makes energy-saving habits easy to maintain.</p>

<h2>Smart Appliances</h2>
<p>Modern appliances are becoming smarter and more energy-efficient. These appliances use sensors, software, and connectivity to optimize how they operate.</p>

<h3>Smart Refrigerators</h3>
<p>Smart refrigerators manage temperature more accurately and reduce energy waste. They can adjust cooling based on usage patterns and internal conditions. Some models alert users if the door is left open, preventing unnecessary energy loss.</p>

<h3>Energy-Efficient Washers and Dryers</h3>
<p>Smart washing machines and dryers use sensors to determine load size and moisture levels. This allows them to use only the water and energy needed for each cycle. Some models can be scheduled to run during off-peak energy hours, reducing strain on power systems.</p>

<h3>Smart Dishwashers</h3>
<p>Smart dishwashers optimize water temperature and cycle length based on how dirty the dishes are. They may also offer eco-friendly modes that use less water and electricity. Remote start features help users run cycles at energy-efficient times.</p>

<h2>Home Energy Monitoring Systems</h2>
<p>Understanding how energy is used is the first step to saving it. Home energy monitoring systems provide detailed insights into electricity consumption.</p>

<h3>Whole-Home Energy Tracking</h3>
